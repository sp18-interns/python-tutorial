# Geometry

- Graph
  - Axes - X axis (+/-) & Y axis (+/-)
  - Quadrants
    - First: `(x: +, y: +)`
    - Second: `(x: -, y: +)`
    - Third: `(x: -, y: -)`
    - Fourth: `(x: +, y: -)`
- Point
  - Representation (Design solution in such as way that representation can change)
    - Cartesian: `x, y`
    - Polar: `point, angle` # TBD
  - Belonging
    - exists on either of `axes`
    - exists within a `quadrant`
  - There's a special point - `origin`
    - it's represented in cartesian as - `Origin: (0, 0)`
  - Updates to existing point
    - Label change
    - Movement from one location to another
  - Distance of a point from origin
  - Distance of point from another point
- Lines # TBD
  - Slope
- Shapes # TBD
- Curves # TBD
